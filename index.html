      <h2 class="about-txt-d">Hi, my name is Mark. I am a materials science engineer with interest in data analytics. I have had an interest in materials science, computer science (software development and analytics), chemistry and physics (electronics) and delved into the nano world. This brought me Merced where I joined the materials and biomaterials science and engineering graduate program school in UC Merced to pursue that interest. I have focused on self assembly methods utilizing liquid crystals to assemble nanoparticles into micro-sized clusters and shell-like structures. My research career has involved working in 4 major projects related to materials self-assembly, photovoltaics (computational), organic crystals (synthesis and characterization), robotics.</h2>

    <div class="about-wrapper">
      <h2 class="about-txt-e">I've utilized computational modeling, automated data acquisition, programming, and developing & implementing experimental protocols. I have strong quantitative and data analytical skills, demonstrated by the creation of scripts in Python, C++, and MATLAB to analyze and visualize spectral and sets of image data in peer-reviewed publications. An effective communicator: assisted students in physics, chemistry, computer science, working in cross-functional collaborative environments, and have given talks in conferences.</h2>
